Readme file for SoftDS1307RTC Library

The SoftDS1307RTC library is provided to demonstrate the Arduino Time library.

You will need the Software I2c library from adafruit:
http://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=13722 (look for the file i2c.zip)
... and the Arduino Time library:
http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/Time

See the TimeRTC_Soft and TimeRTCSet_Soft example sketches for usage

An example circuit is included as well, with PCB layout, schematic and some real pictures.

The components you will need can be purchased from Allied Electronics:

OPTIONAL
I chose to put 10K ohm resistors on the SDA and SCL lines to pull them up to Vcc (+5v), but on the Arduino
you can just enable the builtin pullups like this:

	pinMode(pinNumber, INPUT);
	digitalWrite(pinNumber, HIGH);
